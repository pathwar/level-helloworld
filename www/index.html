    <h1>Welcome to a new world</h1>
    <p>
      This is your last chance. After this, there is no going back.
    </p>

      You take the blue pill and the story ends. You wake in your bed
      and you believe whatever you want to believe.
    </p>

    <p>
      You take the red pill and you stay in Wonderland and I show you
      how deep the rabbit-hole goes.
